# User Login Code Challenge

## Instructions
1. Click "Use this template" to create a copy of this repository in your personal github account.  
1. Update the README in your new repo with:
    * a `How-To` section containing any instructions needed to execute your program.
    * an `Assumptions` section containing documentation on any assumptions made while interpreting the requirements.
1. Send an email to Scoir (sbeyers@scoir.com and msullivan@scoir.com) with a link to your newly created repo containing the completed exercise (preferably no later than one day before your next interview).

## Expectations
1. This exercise is meant to drive a conversation. 
1. Please invest only enough time needed to demonstrate your approach to problem solving, code design, etc.
1. Within reason, treat your solution as if it would become a production system.

## Assignment
Using a JavaScript framework of your choice (preferably [React](https://reactjs.org/)), create a simple login screen that allows users to enter their username and password and submit the login form to a backend process.

Using [GoLang](https://go.dev/), create a backend that processes the login information and checks if the username and password are valid. If the login information is valid, the backend should return a success message to the user. If the login information is invalid, the backend should return an error message that is displayed to the user.
